      Before launching my company, I attended a specialized mathematics and mechanics school with a focus on engineering and design. However, as time passed, I found myself growing increasingly disenchanted with the fields of mechanical engineering and design. Despite this, I discovered that I had a strong aptitude for problem-solving, which led me to explore other avenues where I could apply my skills. It is now clear to me that coding is an ideal fit for my abilities and interests.

As I reflect on my career path, I realize that my strengths lie in analyzing complex situations, finding creative solutions, and developing efficient algorithms.
